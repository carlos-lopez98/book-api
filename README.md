# ðŸ“˜ Book API â€“ Spring Boot Fundamentals Review

This project was built to review and solidify key Spring Boot fundamentals by creating a simple Book management API. It focuses on understanding layered architecture, RESTful endpoints, DTO mapping, and dependency injection â€” without introducing database complexity.

## ðŸš€ What It Covers

- Spring Boot project structure and setup
- Layered architecture: Controller â†’ Service â†’ (Mocked) Repository
- REST API endpoints using `@RestController`, `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc.
- DTO (Data Transfer Object) pattern for clean data flow
- Constructor-based dependency injection
- In-memory data storage (no database)
